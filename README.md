# Agent Based Fire Evacuation Model
This project is a simulation of fire evacuation with people and cars involved.

The simulation above is the simulation of the homogeneous model without house. Although the parameters in the model are not carefully tuned yet, the agents in the model are still able to run away from the fire coming from the left hand side and escape towards on the right hand side.

The simulation above is the simulation of the heterogeneous model without house, exclusively using the Morse potential. In this simulation, cars could run over people, and cars could also adhere to each other and never separate apart afterwards; such phenomenon are not realistic enough, and shall be resolved in the modified model.
